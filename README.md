In this project I recreated the google homepage in HTML and CSS.

While frustrating at points, I learned how to put the skills I learned at freecodecamp.org to use in an actual project.
I tried to do a bit extra by making everything work if you hover over each element. Only thing I haven't implemented is actually being able to go to the links. I may add this in the future as well as actually making it able to search (this would just link to what would happen if you just searched it up on google)
